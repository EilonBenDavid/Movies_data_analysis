# Movies_data_analysis
Using pandas and numpy to get insights from the data.
At first, i used build in pandas functions (info, isnull, describe, etc.) in order to see if i need to do some work to preper the data for analysis.
After i filled all the nulls (and droped some), i analyzed each feature and the relation to other features.
I needed to build some function to cope with some features with multiple values as you can see at the nootbook.
